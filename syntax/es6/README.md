## template literal and multi-line string

- a `string` is an ordered sequence of character values/sequence of one or more characters

- creating a string
        (a)single quotes ['']
        (b)double quotes [""] - `no problem using the first two , as they work similar`
        (c)backticks [``]

-  to create a template literal you use bacticks : 
        - to perform complex operations using strings ie ability to embed a variable inline inside a string , possible using string interpolation[$()]

        - ability to use double quotes and single quotes inside a string without the need to use backtick[/ [0_name, 1_name, ...l_name] = sec_names;
] to escape



## create multiline string

- using template literals

- using + (concatenation  operator) together with line breaker - [\n]

- using \ - (escape character)


# Destructuring Arrays

- unique technique that allows neat extraction of values into new variables

- Avoid repetition / conform to  DRY ([D]on't [R]epeat [Y]ourself)

- using array destructuring to extract values at any index
This can be made possible by using default values
